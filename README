NAME
    CGI::Application::Plugin::Forward - Pass control from one run mode to
    another

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        use base 'CGI::Application';
        use CGI::Application::Plugin::Forward;

        sub setup {
            my $self = shift;
            $self->run_modes([qw(
                start
                second_runmode
            )]);
        }
        sub start {
            my $self = shift;
            return $self->forward('second_runmode');
        }
        sub second_runmode {
            my $self = shift;

            my $rm = $self->get_current_runmode;  # 'second_runmode'

        }

DESCRIPTION
    The forward method passes control to another run mode and returns its
    output. This is equivalent to calling "$self->$other_runmode", except
    that CGI::Application's internal value of the current run mode is
    updated.

    This means that calling "$self->get_current_runmode" after calling
    "forward" will return the name of the new run mode. This is useful for
    modules that depend on the name of the current run mode such as
    CGI::Application::Plugin::AnyTemplate.

    For example, here's how to pass control to a run mode named
    "other_action" from "start" while updating the value of
    "current_run_mode":

        sub setup {
            my $self = shift;
            $self->run_modes({
                start         => 'start',
                other_action  => 'other_method',
            });
        }
        sub start {
            my $self = shift;
            return $self->forward('other_action');
        }
        sub other_method {
            my $self = shift;

            my $rm = $self->get_current_runmode;  # 'other_action'
        }

    Note that forward accepts the *name* of the run mode (in this case
    *'other_action'*), which might not be the same as the name of the method
    that handles the run mode (in this case *'other_method'*)

    You can still call "$self->other_method" directly, but
    "current_run_mode" will not be updated:

        sub setup {
            my $self = shift;
            $self->run_modes({
                start         => 'start',
                other_action  => 'other_method',
            });
        }
        sub start {
            my $self = shift;
            return $self->other_method;
        }
        sub other_method {
            my $self = shift;

            my $rm = $self->get_current_runmode;  # 'start'
        }

METHODS
  forward
    Runs another run mode passing any parameters you supply. Returns the
    output of the new run mode.

        return $self->forward('run_mode_name', @run_mode_params);
